  description: 
    This is the set of all AgriStack Consent Management (ACM) APIs written using OpenAPI
    specification.

    # Introduction
    
    There are five categories of APIs in the ACM Framework---network manager (NM) APIs, 
    auth APIs, metadata APIs, consent APIs, and data APIs. Each of these categories is 
    listed in the left panel and the individual APIs are described below.

    # OpenAPI Specification

    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard, language-agnostic 
    interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and 
    understand capabilities of services without access to source code or documentation. 
    Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes 
    the guesswork in calling services.
